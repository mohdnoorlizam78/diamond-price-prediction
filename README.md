Diamond Price Prediction
This project aims to predict the price of diamonds based on specific features such as carat, cut, color, clarity, and other physical attributes. The project demonstrates the end-to-end machine learning workflow including data preprocessing, model training, experiment tracking with MLflow, and deployment using Streamlit.

Project Structure
The project is organized into the following directories:

data/: Contains the diamonds.csv dataset.
notebooks/: Contains Jupyter notebooks for data exploration and model training.
src/: Contains the main application code, including the deployment script (app.py).
models/: Stores the trained machine learning models and other serialized objects.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

Python 3.7 or higher
Git
Virtualenv (optional, but recommended)
Installation
Clone the Repository:

git clone https://github.com/mohdnoorlizam78/diamond-price-prediction.git
cd diamond-price-prediction
Create a Virtual Environment (optional but recommended):

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use venv\Scripts\activate
Install Required Packages:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Ensure the requirements.txt file includes all necessary packages like pandas, scikit-learn, mlflow, streamlit, etc.

Download the Dataset:
Place the diamonds.csv dataset in the data/ directory.

Running the Project
1. Training the Model:
To train the model, you can use the provided Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts. The training code includes data preprocessing, model development, and evaluation.

python src/train_model.py
The trained model and preprocessing objects will be saved in the models/ directory.

2. Tracking Experiments with MLflow:
MLflow is used to track experiments and manage the model lifecycle. To view the experiment logs, run:

mlflow ui
Open http://127.0.0.1:5000 in your browser to see the MLflow dashboard.

3. Deploying the Model with Streamlit:
The project includes a Streamlit app (app.py) that allows users to input diamond features and get a price prediction.

To run the app, execute:

streamlit run src/app.py
Open http://localhost:8501 in your browser to interact with the application.

Usage
Input Fields: The app allows you to input diamond features like carat, cut, color, and clarity.
Prediction: The app will output the predicted price of the diamond based on the input features.
Files and Directories
src/app.py: The deployment script that runs the Streamlit app.
src/train_model.py: Script to train the machine learning model.
models/: Directory containing the trained model and other serialized objects.
notebooks/: Contains Jupyter notebooks used for data exploration and model development.
data/: Contains the diamonds.csv dataset.
Model Performance
The model's performance metrics are tracked and logged using MLflow. The final model is evaluated based on metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (RÂ²).
